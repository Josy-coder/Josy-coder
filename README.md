### Hey there 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

## 🗒️ About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on **TypeScript**, **Golang**, and modern web technologies. Over the past few years, I've worked on high-impact projects from government platforms in agriculture and climate to AI-driven systems and internal business tools.

When I’m not coding, I am trying to overtake AI in problem-solving (still coding...I guess🤷‍♂️), and occasionally overanalyzing sci-fi movies.

## 🚀 Technologies I use day-to-day

- **Languages**: TypeScript, Go, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, Express, React, Svelte (currently exploring)  
- **ORMs**: Prisma (leaning towards this), Drizzle  
- **Cloud**: AWS, Google Cloud  
- **Databases & Tools**: PostgreSQL, Convex, Redis, Docker, Git

## ✨ What I'm Up To Now

- Building my **personal site + blog** to talk about dev-life things like:  
  *“Why I moved from Go to TypeScript for IrankHub (when the trend says otherwise)”*
- Looking for **cool side projects** to finally use **Svelte** in something serious.
